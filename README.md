## FireDepartment Calls
Performed the data visualization on the call services received by firedepartment. Worked on the data discovery, data cleaning and data merging to generate the dashboards in PowerBI. Created the columns and measures using the provided data and made the analysis.

### Description
The data is provided with the type of calls that the fire department is receiving and respoding to the call based on the severity (based on severity of incidents), time taken by the fire fighters to respond to the particular incident and requirement of the hospital admissions.
I have created the columns(extension of a table that’s evaluated for each row) and measures with the provided dataset. The dashboard is generated with the time series graphs, pie charts, column charts, Gauge, tables and Slicers.

### Conclusion
From the analysis, more number of calls are received to fire fighters during weekdays; in the weekdays Friday has recorded the highest number of received calls and most of the calls are received on the month of October(year 2017) and Zipcode 94102 has recorded highest number of incidents. 
Also found, the call delay time (Difference between the time that the fire fighters received the call and the dispatched time) is 2.30 minutes. Treasure Island has the longest response time, the number of units should be increased in that neighbourhood area.
